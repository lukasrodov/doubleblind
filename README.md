Evaluating an double blind study inÂ R
In a friend group of mine in Czechia are strong opinions about different beer brands. I always wondered if their opionion is founded in the taste of the beer itself or the marketing of the brand. Therefore I decided to go through a double-blind tasting. I bought nine different beers a got my friends together. Nobody knew which beer they were tasting and (nearly) everybody had a different beer at the same time. It has to be noted that evaluation, with the methods used is not suited for such a small sample size. I was more interested in using my knowledge of R. 
In this repository you find the R-Code and the original data. I wrote more about it in the post on medium.
